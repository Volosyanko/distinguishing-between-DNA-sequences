# distinguishing-between-dna-sequences
Bacteriophages, or just phages, are viruses that are the natural predators of bacteria and argued to be the most abundant entities on earth. They have been found to contribute to the evolution of bacterial cells within the human body by acquiring and spreading DNA. Despite their considerable presence in the human body, it is not clear how they impact human health.

In this report I aim to create a model for distinguishing between human and phage DNA sequences. To achieve this aim I will create decision trees and random forests which will operate using DNA base information from our dataset of 600 (300 human and 300 phage) DNA sequences. I hypothesise that human and phage DNA follow different sequence patterns and that by breaking up combinations into individual base numbers we can identify phage DNA from human DNA.
