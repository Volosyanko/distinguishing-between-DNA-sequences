With this mini project my main aim was to use **decision trees** and **random forests** to distinguish between human and phage DNA sequences the following dataset, [dataset.txt](https://github.com/Volosyanko/distinguishing-between-dna-sequences/blob/main/dataset.txt). The code is found in ['code.R'](https://github.com/Volosyanko/distinguishing-between-dna-sequences/blob/main/code.R) and the report explaining my findings is found in ['short-report.docx'](https://github.com/Volosyanko/distinguishing-between-dna-sequences/blob/main/short-report.docx).
